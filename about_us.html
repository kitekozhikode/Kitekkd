                <p>Presently, KITE is governed by a five-member Board of Directors, which includes the Secretary,
                    General Education Department (serving as the Chairperson), the CEO of KITE, Director of General
                    Education, the Additional Secretary from the Department of IT and Additional Secretary from the
                    Department of Finance.</p>

                <p>KITE was set-up as IT@School project during 2001-02 to fuel ICT enabled education in the schools in
                    the State. This is as per the recommendation in the IT in Education Vision Document published by the
                    IT Task Force headed by Prof.U.R.Rao as Chairman, to implement a time-bound project for phase wise
                    introduction of Information Technology into school curriculum.</p>

                <p>In August 2017, IT@School was transformed into a Company fully owned by Government of Kerala. KITE is
                    the first Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Company of the Education Department of the State and also
                    the first SPV to get funded by Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the apex body
                    for monitoring all the projects envisaged by the Govt. The scope of KITE has also been extended to
                    the Higher Education sector also to fuel ICT support to Arts & Science colleges, Engineering
                    colleges and Universities.</p>

                <p>The core objective of KITE was to inculcate ICT enabled activities in over 16000 schools in the
                    State. The first breakthrough of the unique initiative came in 2005 when Information Technology was
                    made a compulsory subject in Std 10. The launch of EDUSAT operations and broadband connectivity to
                    schools commenced since then, the VICTERS channel under KITE was setup in 2005 and it is the first
                    Complete Educational Channel in the Country. By effectively making use of the Centrally sponsored
                    ‘ICT at School ‘scheme, KITE provided ICT infrastructure to 4071 schools during 2007- 2012. In 2016,
                    the ICT intervention in Lower Primary and Upper Primary sections was reinitiated, by launching
                    exclusive ICT Textbooks viz; Kalipetti (for Std 1 to 4) and e@Vidya (for Std 5 to 7). As many as
                    1.70 Lakh teachers and 43 lakh students stand benefited through the ICT initiatives by KITE every
                    year, enabling the teachers to transact their subjects more effectively using ICT tools and also
                    equipping the students to learn various subjects with ease by using ICT.</p>

                <p>KITE amply supplements the State Government’s Public Education Rejuvenation Mission (Pothu
                    Vidyabhyasa Samrakshana Yagnam) with initiatives such as Samagra Content Portal, Sampoorna School
                    Management software and School Wiki which connects 15,000 schools for collaborative content
                    development process. A major highlight was the ‘Little KITEs IT Clubs’ programme under which over

                    Cyber Safety, Hardware, Electronics, Malayalam computing, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics etc.</p>

                    its of FOSS based Operating System which is being used in all schools. The use of FOSS not only
                    enabled unrestricted editing and sharing of educational content among teachers and students but also
